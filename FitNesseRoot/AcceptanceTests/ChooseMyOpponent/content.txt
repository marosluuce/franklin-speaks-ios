'''Easy player.'''

|check         |current player|Player X|
|check         |square        |2 |is |O|

'''Hard Player'''
I'm not sure if this is the correct move for the hard player.  I think it is, but just fix if I'm wrong.

|script        |Tic Tac Toe Game       |
|launch                                |
|tap new game  |hard_ai                |
|check         |current player|Player X|
|move to square|1                      |
|check         |current player|Player X|
|check         |square        |5 |is |O|

'''Cannot move during opponent turn''' 

Make sure you can't make a diybke nive move and that the opponent can take it.

|script        |Tic Tac Toe Game       |
