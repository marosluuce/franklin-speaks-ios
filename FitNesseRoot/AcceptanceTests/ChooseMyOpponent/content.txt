'''Easy player.'''

'''Hard Player'''
I'm not sure if this is the correct move for the hard player.  I think it is, but just fix if I'm wrong.

|script              |Tic Tac Toe Game       |
|launch                                      |
|choose opponent     |hard                   |
|check current player|Player X               |
|move to square      |1                      |
|wait for opponent move                      |
|check               |current player|Player X|
|check               |square        |5 |is |O|

'''Cannot move during opponent turn''' 

Make sure you can't make a diybke nive move and that the opponent can take it.
